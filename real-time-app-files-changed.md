## Summary

The app evolved from a basic authentication setup to a real-time polling application, going through multiple iterations including counter functionality (later removed) and voting/polling implementations.

## Development Evolution:
1. Started with authentication framework
2. Added real-time counter functionality with Durable Objects
3. Evolved to voting system
4. Refined to polling system with better UI components
5. Removed counter functionality to focus on polls
6. Multiple iterations with component refactoring and feature improvements
