# Real-Time App Complete Development History

This document traces the complete evolution of the `real-time-app/` folder from its initial creation as an rwsdk-based application through all its development phases until it was moved to `rwsdk-apps/real-time-app/`.

## Timeline Overview

The real-time app was developed over **1 day and 14 hours** (Sep 12 06:22 - Sep 13 20:19) through **12 major commits**, evolving from a basic rwsdk app with authentication to a full-featured real-time polling application.

- `src/pollDurableObject.ts` (evolved from votingDurableObject.ts)
- `migrations/0002_add_polls_and_choices.sql`

## Development Insights

1. **Iterative Evolution:** The app evolved organically from counter â†’ voting â†’ polls
2. **Consistent Architecture:** Always used rwsdk framework with Cloudflare Workers
3. **Real-time Focus:** WebSocket integration was present from the first real-time commit
4. **Clean Transitions:** Old components were properly removed when architecture changed
5. **Professional Organization:** Proper separation of concerns with clear directory structure

This comprehensive history shows a well-structured development process that maintained architectural consistency while evolving functionality from simple real-time counting to sophisticated polling capabilities.
