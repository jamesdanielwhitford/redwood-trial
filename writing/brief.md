Brief: RedwoodSDK Developer Experience Evolution Guide
Writer: James
Customer: Ritza, maybe RedwoodSDK

## Article Concept
**Title:** "Cloudflare's Great DX Gets Even Better: RedwoodSDK's React Abstractions Tested"

**Target Audience:** Developers already familiar with/using Cloudflare Workers who want to see what's next

**Angle:** Developer Experience Evolution
- Acknowledge Cloudflare Workers already have excellent DX (fast cold starts, edge deployment, solid Wrangler tooling)
- Position RedwoodSDK as the next evolution, not fixing a "bad" experience
- Show concrete improvements: React server components, automatic Durable Objects wiring, zero-config auth
- Use side-by-side comparison of identical live voting app

**Key Value Props to Demonstrate:**
- React-based abstractions for Cloudflare Workers
- Automatic real-time functionality via React server components + Durable Objects
- Batteries-included setup (D1, R2, Queues) with easy config access
- Local dev environment that matches production
- Zero-config passkey auth
- Command-line deployment with CI/CD by default

## Implementation Plan
1. Build live voting app with raw Cloudflare Workers + Wrangler
   - Manual Durable Objects setup
   - WebSocket boilerplate
   - Auth integration
   - Deployment configuration

2. Build identical app with RedwoodSDK
   - React server components for real-time features
   - Automatic Durable Objects + WebSocket handling
   - Built-in auth abstractions
   - Zero-config deployment

3. Side-by-side comparison focusing on:
   - Code reduction (estimated 240 lines â†’ 40 lines)
   - Configuration simplification
   - Development workflow improvements
   - Deployment ease

## Writing Approach
- Problem-based structure: show Cloudflare Workers complexity first
- Concrete comparisons with line counts and code snippets
- Multiple screenshots/diagrams for visual learners
- Accommodate skimmers with clear headings and visual breaks
