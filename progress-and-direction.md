# Project Progress and Direction

## What's Been Done So Far

Built 3 simple apps to compare different full-stack approaches:
1. **Traditional Stack**: React + Express + Postgres
2. **Cloudflare Stack**: Workers + Wrangler + D1
3. **RedwoodSDK Stack**

## Key RedwoodSDK Value Discovered

### Core Benefits
- **Streamlines Cloudflare config** - removes complexity of manual Cloudflare Worker setup
- **React-based abstractions** for Cloudflare Workers - familiar React patterns for serverless

### Standout Feature: Real-time Applications
- React server components using Cloudflare Durable Objects abstraction
- Create a key/room/id to group clients in worker config
- Redwood auto-wires Durable Objects + WebSocket handling
- When clients in same "room" update state → server component re-renders → all connected clients update

### Developer Experience Improvements
- **Batteries included setup**: D1, R2, Queues pre-configured
- Easy access to editing Cloudflare configs
- Local dev environment automatically matches production
- Command line deployment
- CI/CD setup by default
- Simple Passkey Auth abstraction

## Agreed Direction (Discussion with Gareth)

### Approach: Problem-Based vs Solution-Based
- Show how to build something **without** Redwood first
- Highlight the difficulties and pain points
- Then show the Redwood version demonstrating the improvement
- Can skip non-Cloudflare version - go straight from Wrangler → Redwood

### Chosen Example: Live Voting App
- Users vote between options (e.g., dog vs cat)
- Admin/creator sees vote counts change live as people vote
- Perfect for demonstrating real-time capabilities

### Problems Being Addressed
1. **Cloudflare config complexity**
2. **Auth boilerplate**  
3. **Real-time functionality boilerplate**

### Note
RedwoodSDK docs show a live voting app demo but don't show how to create it. Using the same concept is fine since our guide has a different goal (showing value rather than learning Redwood).
